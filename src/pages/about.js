				<p>
					I have always wanted to use programming to build something cool and amazing. I enrolled and received the Full-Stack Engineer degree from Codecademy in
					2021. This program was intensive - it provided a boot camp-like experience. The program often forced me to learn on the spot by making me program
					things I don't yet know, and it taught me to learn how to fix bugs that define the law of the universe. I rigorously studied and coded every day,
					which allowed me to graduated before the estimated six months. I am highly self-motivated and a quick learner. When I'm not coding, I'd like to think
					and discuss business opportunities or flying drones. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS degree in Energy Engineering in Spring 2021.
