			<h3>Description:</h3>
			<p>
				This is an e-commerce website for Apple product. Demonstrated the ability to use React to render UI elements, setup server using Express, and connect the
				server to PostgreSQL database. I took many inspiration from the Apple website, from the color schemes to the rounded corners of the buttons and various
				elements.

				production - Use Heroku to host all front-end and back-ends
			</p>
			<h3>How did I overcome:</h3>
			<p>I have learnt a ton for this project.</p>
			<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
			<p>React for UI, Redux for state management. Express/Node JS for server. PostgreSQL for database. Hosted both front-end and back-end on Heroku.</p>
